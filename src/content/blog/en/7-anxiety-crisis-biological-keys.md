Does it feel like your mind has entered "short circuit" mode? ⚡️🧠

First, breathe. I want you to know something fundamental: an anxiety crisis is not a character weakness. It's your nervous system trapped in a biological survival response. It's intense energy seeking an outlet.

At our wellness center **Marce Anahata**, we understand that to heal the mind, we must involve the body. "Positive thinking" is not enough when the biology of fear has been activated.

In this video, I share 4 "Biological Keys of Light." These are somatic movement exercises specifically designed to turn off the alarm in your sympathetic system (alert/flight) and activate your parasympathetic system (calm/safety). We're going to transmute that fear into vital force.

## The 4 Biological Keys to Regulate Your Nervous System

Perform these movements when you feel the wave of anxiety beginning to rise. You don't need to do them perfectly, you need to do them with intention.

### 1. The "Miguel Shake" (Tension Release)

**The purpose:** Release the excess cortisol and adrenaline that accumulates instantly in the face of fear.

**How it works:** By raising your shoulders towards your ears (tensing to the maximum) and then releasing them sharply while giving small jumps, you're activating a biological "discharge" response. It's the physical way of telling your alert sympathetic system: "The danger has passed, you can release the load." It instantly relaxes the trapezius and neck, where we tend to carry the weight of the world.

### 2. The "Earth Rotation" (Vital Activation)

**The purpose:** Stimulate the adrenal glands, make the spine flexible, and mobilize stagnant energy.

**How it works:** Perform a block rotation with your torso, letting your arms move freely like ropes. Allow your hands to gently tap the area of your kidneys (in the lower back). This is where the adrenals reside and, energetically, our "vital battery." This massage helps regulate stress hormone production and facilitates energy flow to the brain.

### 3. The "Wings of Rafael" (Return Pumping)

**The purpose:** Oxygenate the blood quickly, stimulate the lymphatic system, and exit paralysis.

**How it works:** Perform gentle jumps where the heels impact the ground; this acts as a pump for venous return. At the same time, move your arms energetically forward and backward, expanding the rib cage. You're "cleaning" your energetic field and bringing new oxygen to dissipate the mental fog that anxiety produces.

### 4. The "Chamuel Propeller" (Grounding and Expansion)

**The purpose:** Create a balance between the security of the earth and the openness of the air. Feel safe.

**How it works:** Adopt a lunge position (one leg firmly forward, the other back). This activates the large leg muscles, indicating to the nervous system that you're firm, grounded, and present (not in a catastrophic future). While maintaining a firm base, move your arms like a giant propeller, opening the chest to activate deep breathing and the parasympathetic system.

## Do you need deeper support?

These keys are wonderful emergency tools for day-to-day life. However, if you feel that your nervous system lives in constant alert and it's hard for you to return to calm on your own, sometimes we need a safe space where *others* help us regulate.

At our sanctuary in Medellín, we offer experiences designed to reset your system from the root, without you having to make the effort alone:

* **[Sound Therapy (Sound Healing)](/en/terapia-sonido):** Immerse yourself in a bath of healing frequencies. Tibetan bowls and gong work directly on your autonomic nervous system, inducing deep states of relaxation that the mind struggles to reach on its own.
* **[Conscious Movement and Yoga Classes](/en/clases):** Learn to inhabit your body in a gentle and consistent way, building resilience for difficult moments in community.

You don't have to go through this alone. Your peace is your power.
