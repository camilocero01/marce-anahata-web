A **women’s circle in Medellín** is an intimate gathering where we meet to speak from the heart, listen without judgment, and remember that healing is softer when it is accompanied. At Marce Anahata, each circle is a ceremony of presence, care, and community.

## What is a women’s circle?

It is a sacred space where women sit in circle to share, breathe, and hold one another. There are no hierarchies. No pressure. Only a loving agreement of listening, presence, and respect for what each woman is living.

In these gatherings, we:

- Honor personal processes with care and confidentiality
- Create a safe environment to express emotions
- Reconnect with intuition, body, and voice
- Strengthen trust and sisterhood

## What do we experience in a circle?

Each circle is unique, but the experience usually includes:

- **Opening ritual** to arrive fully present
- **Gentle movement or conscious breath** to inhabit the body
- **Sharing circle** to speak from what is real
- **Guided meditation** to integrate what is lived
- **Symbolic closing** to return to daily life with clarity

## Who is this circle for?

This space is for you if:

- You are seeking community and emotional support
- You need a moment for yourself, without masks
- You want to reconnect with your body and feminine energy
- You desire a safe place to speak and be heard

No previous experience is required. Only the willingness to be present.

## What to bring

- Comfortable clothing
- Water bottle
