A **women’s circle in Medellín** is an intimate gathering where we meet to speak from the heart, listen without judgment, and remember that healing is softer when it is accompanied. At Marce Anahata, each circle is a ceremony of presence, care, and community.

## 🌙 March Special Theme: Releasing Energetic Larvae and Sexual Memories (Personal & Ancestral)

This circle is dedicated to releasing energetic larvae and sexual memories, personal and ancestral. It is a loving space to recognize what has been stored in the body and in the womb, and to open a path of cleansing, compassion, and return to our feminine energy.

In the womb healing and cacao circle on **November 14, 2026**, we began a 9-month cycle. That day we spoke about it and felt it. From this **March** circle onward, we resume that process, connecting with the creative power and sacred memory of the womb, to heal, release, and inhabit our bodies with presence.

## What is a women’s circle?

It is a sacred space where women sit in circle to share, breathe, and hold one another. There are no hierarchies. No pressure. Only a loving agreement of listening, presence, and respect for what each woman is living.

In these gatherings, we:

- Honor personal processes with care and confidentiality
- Create a safe environment to express emotions
- Reconnect with intuition, body, and voice
- Strengthen trust and sisterhood

## What will we experience in this gathering?

This March circle includes:

- **Opening ritual** with cacao and energetic cleansing to prepare womb and heart
- **Breathwork and gentle movement** to release stored energy and activate feminine energy
- **Guided meditation**: "Releasing Memories" to let go of sexual records, personal and ancestral
- **Sharing circle**: Safe space to speak from the heart and be held by other women
- **Closing ritual**: Womb-healing intention and commitment to the 9-month cycle
