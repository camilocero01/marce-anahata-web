Conscious breathing is a simple yet powerful practice. Dedicating just 3 to 5 minutes a day to mindful breathing can help you reduce stress, improve focus, and regulate your nervous system.

## 4-Step Technique (2-4-6-4)

1. Inhale through your nose counting to 2.
2. Gently hold the air counting to 4.
3. Exhale through your nose counting to 6.
4. Pause without air counting to 4.

Repeat the cycle 6 to 10 times. Keep your shoulders and jaw relaxed. If you feel dizzy, return to natural breathing.

## Benefits

- Reduces anxiety and stress.
- Improves mental clarity.
- Supports digestion and rest.
- Increases mind-body connection.

Practicing it in the morning or before sleep creates sustainable wellness habits.
