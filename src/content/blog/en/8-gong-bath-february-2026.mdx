## What is a gong bath?

A gong bath is a therapeutic sound experience in which people lie down or sit comfortably while receiving an "immersion" of vibrations created by the gong. It is not a water bath, but a bath of sound waves that envelops the entire body and mind.

This ancestral instrument produces a wide sound spectrum that favors introspection and deep relaxation. In a safe and contained space, sound acts as a guide: it accompanies you to release accumulated tension, lower mental noise, and return to center. That's why a gong bath in Medellín is not just a music session: it's a conscious rest ritual.

## How does it work?

The gong produces rich, complex, and multidimensional frequencies that:

- Travel through the air
- Gently penetrate the body
- Interact with muscles, bones, nervous system, and energy fields

These vibrations help the body enter a deep state of relaxation similar to the brain waves of meditation or sleep. In practical terms, sound stimulates an internal "gear shift": it decreases mental hyperactivity and allows the nervous system to shift from alert to rest.

When the body receives these frequencies, it usually responds by releasing muscular tensions, regulating breathing, and stabilizing the mind. That's why gong sound therapy is a powerful tool for people living with stress, anxiety, or emotional fatigue.

## What does it feel like?

Each person experiences it differently, but commonly you may feel:

- Deep relaxation
- Sensation of lightness or rest
- Gentle vibrations throughout the body
- Images, emotions, or mental clarity

It's possible to fall asleep, have sensations of heat or cold, or feel time dissolving. Some people perceive mental clarity, others release emotions gently. Everything is valid. The gong bath doesn't require you to "do something"; it simply opens a space for the body and mind to self-regulate.

## Benefits of the gong bath

The benefits of a gong bath are felt at different levels. It's not a "quick fix," but rather a deep rest that can sustain your well-being over time.

- **🌿 Physical:** releases tension, harmonizes the nervous system, promotes rest, and helps the body recover. Many people notice looser muscles and broader breathing.
- **🧘 Mental:** reduces stress, calms the mind, lowers anxiety. Sound helps decrease mental noise and regain clarity.
- **💛 Emotional:** helps process emotions and connect with inner peace. It's common to feel relief, containment, and lightness.
- **✨ Energetic/Spiritual:** raises vibration, opens space for intuition, clarity, and balance. The sensation is of "reordering" the internal.

## What do you do during the session?

People:

- Lie down on a mat or blanket
- Close their eyes
- Breathe deeply
- Allow the sound to do its work

The session begins with a brief preparation to release the mind. Then, the gong grows in layers of sound until creating an enveloping atmosphere, and finally descends gently towards silence. That closing is a moment of integration, where the body assimilates the experience.

No previous experience required. Just receive.

## How long does it last?

A gong bath lasts between **45 and 75 minutes** depending on the facilitator or type of session. In addition to the sound time, there are usually a few minutes for accommodation and closing to integrate what was experienced.

## Why "bath"?

Just as a bath cleans the body, the gong cleanses the cells, mind, emotions, and energy using vibrations instead of water. Sound touches and cleanses you like a contactless massage, reaching deep layers that we sometimes can't access with the mind.

Its restorative effect is compared to a deep sleep of **8 hours in just 45 minutes** because the nervous system enters a very deep rest, similar to that achieved in meditative or restorative sleep states.
