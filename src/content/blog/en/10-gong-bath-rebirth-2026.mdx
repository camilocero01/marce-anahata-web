The **Gong Bath Rebirth** is an invitation to release what no longer serves you and open space for a new cycle. Through the vibration of the gong, the body and mind rest deeply, release tension, and regain clarity.

This experience is designed for anyone who feels they need a reset: letting go of emotional weight, restoring vital energy, and reconnecting with the intention to be reborn with more presence and lightness.

## Rebirth: the intention of this gathering

This gong bath is focused on **rebirth**: the ability to let go of what no longer resonates and open to a lighter, clearer, and more authentic version of yourself. In a held and safe space, sound becomes a bridge to inner renewal, helping you release, reorder energy, and return to center.

## What is a gong bath?

A gong bath is a therapeutic sound experience where participants lie down or sit comfortably while receiving an “immersion” of vibrations created by the gong. It is not a water bath, but a bath of sound waves that envelops the whole body and mind.

This ancestral instrument produces a wide spectrum of sound that encourages introspection and deep relaxation. In a safe and supportive space, the sound acts as a guide: it helps you release accumulated tension, quiet the mind, and return to center. That’s why a gong bath in Medellín is not just a music session—it’s a ritual of conscious rest.

## How does it work?

The gong produces rich, complex, multidimensional frequencies that:

- Travel through the air
- Gently penetrate the body
- Interact with muscles, bones, the nervous system, and energy fields

These vibrations help the body enter a deep state of relaxation similar to the brain waves of meditation or sleep. In practical terms, sound initiates an internal “gear shift”: it reduces mental hyperactivity and allows the nervous system to move from alertness to rest.

## What does it feel like?

Each person experiences it differently, but common sensations include:

- Deep relaxation
- A sense of lightness or rest
- Gentle vibrations throughout the body
- Images, emotions, or mental clarity

Some people fall asleep, feel warmth or cold, or sense time slowing down. Others release emotions softly. Everything is welcome. The gong bath does not ask you to “do” anything—only to receive.

## Benefits of a gong bath

The benefits of a gong bath are felt at multiple levels. It’s not a “quick fix,” but a deep rest that supports long-term well-being.

- **🌿 Physical:** releases tension, harmonizes the nervous system, supports rest and recovery.
- **🧘 Mental:** reduces stress, calms the mind, lowers anxiety, restores clarity.
- **💛 Emotional:** helps process emotions and reconnect with inner peace.
- **✨ Energetic/Spiritual:** raises vibration, opens space for intuition, clarity, and balance.

## What happens during the session?

Participants:

- Lie down on a mat or blanket
- Close their eyes
- Breathe deeply
- Allow the sound to do its work

The session begins with a brief preparation to settle the mind. Then the gong builds in layers of sound, creating an enveloping atmosphere, and finally softens into silence. That closing is a moment of integration, where the body assimilates the experience.

No previous experience is required. Only receive.

## How long does it last?

A gong bath lasts between **45 and 75 minutes** depending on the facilitator or session type. In addition to the sound time, there are usually a few minutes for settling in and closing to integrate the experience.

## Why “bath”?

Just as a water bath cleanses the body, the gong cleanses cells, mind, emotions, and energy using vibrations instead of water. Sound touches and cleanses like a contactless massage, moving through deeper layers that the mind often can’t reach.

Its restorative effect is often compared to **8 hours of sleep in just 45 minutes**, because the nervous system enters a very deep rest similar to meditative or restorative sleep states.
