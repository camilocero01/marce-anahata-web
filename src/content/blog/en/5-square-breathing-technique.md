Sometimes we feel that anxiety or stress is a giant wave that tumbles us and over which we have no control. However, we carry with us a powerful tool, free and available 24/7: **Our breath.**

Today I want to teach you in depth the **Square Breathing** technique (or *Sama Vritti* in Sanskrit). It's so effective that not only yogis use it; it's even used by elite special forces and high-performance athletes to stay calm under extreme pressure.

## What is Square Breathing?

"Sama" means *equal* and "Vritti" means *movement* or *fluctuation*. This technique consists of equalizing the times of the four phases of breathing, creating a rhythmic pattern that sends an immediate signal to your brain: *"Everything is fine, you're safe"*.

Visualize a square. Each side of the square represents a phase of breathing.

## Step by step (4-4-4-4 Technique)

Sit with your back straight (you can be in a chair or on the floor). Relax your shoulders and follow this cycle:

1. **INHALE (4 seconds):** Take air gently through your nose while mentally counting to four. Feel how your lungs fill.
2. **HOLD (4 seconds):** Keep the air inside without tensing your throat. Just let it be.
3. **EXHALE (4 seconds):** Release all the air through your nose gently and unhurriedly.
4. **HOLD EMPTY (4 seconds):** Stay without air in your lungs, in pause, before starting again.

Repeat this cycle for at least 3 or 4 minutes.

> **Note:** If 4 seconds seems like too much and overwhelms you, start with 3. The important thing is not the number, but that the four sides of the "square" last the same.

## Why does it work?

This practice directly stimulates the **vagus nerve**, which is responsible for activating your parasympathetic nervous system (the "rest and digest" mode). By doing so, you reduce cortisol (stress hormone), lower blood pressure, and improve your mental clarity.

It's ideal to use:
* Before a difficult conversation.
* If you wake up in the middle of the night and can't sleep.
* When you feel anxiety starting to rise in your chest.

## Breathe better, live better

Breathing is the gateway to controlling your energy, but it's just the beginning. In my classes, we not only practice asanas (postures), but we integrate these *Pranayama* techniques so you learn to manage your emotions on and off the mat.

If you want to turn these tools into a habit and deepen your well-being, I invite you to practice with me. I'm in Medellín in the El Poblado neighborhood.

Remember: If you control your breath, you control your mind.
