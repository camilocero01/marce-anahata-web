          This website collects information in two ways:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Data you voluntarily provide:</strong> When you click on contact buttons (WhatsApp or Email) to schedule a class or session, I will receive your phone number or email address so I can respond to your inquiry and manage your appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation Data (Cookies):</strong> I use analytics tools to understand how users interact with the website and improve the user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#243c5a] mt-8 mb-4">3. Use of Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          This website uses <strong>Google Analytics 4</strong>, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Analytics uses "cookies" (text files stored on your computer) to help me analyze how users use the site. The information generated by these cookies (including your anonymized IP address) is transmitted and stored by Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does Google do with your data?</strong> Google uses this information to evaluate site usage, compile reports on site activity, and provide other services related to site activity and internet usage.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          <strong>Your consent matters:</strong> When you visit this site, you will see a banner that allows you to accept or reject the use of analytical cookies.
